## 🔥 Burn Mechanism
DREAM uses a transparent, irreversible burn model:

- Any liquidity removed from the market is converted into DREAM.
- 100% of that DREAM is sent to the burn address.
- No one can ever retrieve or spend these tokens.
- This creates a long-term deflationary effect tied to real market activity.

## 🔒 Why This Burn Address Is Unrecoverable
- The wallet was created solely for burning.
- The seed phrase was never saved.
- The wallet app was deleted immediately after creation.
- No outgoing transactions are possible.
- No private key exists.

This ensures DREAM burns are permanent and trustless.
